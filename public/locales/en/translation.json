      "I started my camera + bicycle romance for safety reasons. Through several years of cycling around Szczecin I had few dangerous incidents. Most of them were the fault of careless car drivers. After another such case, I mounted the camera on the bicycle as a \"black box\". It was in the spring of 2018.",
      "Few months later I came up with an idea to archive all these videos. Szczecin and its infrastructure have been changing quite dynamically in recent months so I thought the movies would be a good documentation of this. I plan to make some changes here in the near future and I will share more videos of my tours."
